# Kawa's Inform 6 Drabbles

Do what you want with these, all I *humbly* request is that you keep my name attached to it somehow.

So what've we got so far...

## Simple battle system
Vivi @orioel rambled about how hard it was to write a battle system with RPG stats and such in Inform 7, because she couldn't figure out the exact near-English phrasing required... where I could see it. Big mistake. So I told her it might be easier to just use Inform 6. Then I got bored.

Therefore, `candy.inf` is a complete(?), self-contained demonstration that I whipped up where one of Vivi's main characters *Candy McGee* fights a minor demon and an imp in an arena, and can drop her gun to reduce her attack stats to 1. Also comes pre-compiled as `candy.z5`.

## All-in-one menu system
The DM4's footnotes are *particularly* tiny so by the time I saw that its chapter on menu systems had one mentioning *InvisiClues* style hints and such, I'd already implemented my own, among other features, in a single file.

Note that this is quite tailored for use in my own game, so anything involving the status line may not quite work for you. Go ahead, change it if you want.

## *Shogun* inspired inline menus
**[V6 only]** Left-aligned, but who cares? It's a freakin' menu that's part of the main text window!

## Top Down Maze
Coming later, maybe. Watch this space.
